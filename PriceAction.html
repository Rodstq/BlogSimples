  <h2> Price Action</h2>
  <p>
   The price action is a method of billable 
	negotiation in the analysis of the basic 
	movements of the price, to generate signals 
	of entry and exit in trades and that stands
 	out for its reliability and for not requiring 
 	the use of indicators. It is a form of technical 
 	analysis, since it ignores the fundamental factors 
 	of a security and looks primarily at the security's 
 	price history. What differentiates it from most 
 	forms of technical analysis is that its main focus 
 	is the relation of a security's current price to its 
 	past prices as opposed to values derived from that price
  	history. This history includes swing highs and swing 
  	lows, trend lines, and support and resistance levels.
